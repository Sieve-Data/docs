title: "sieve.reference"
---

```python
def reference(
  name: str = None,
  id: str = None
)
```

A `sieve.reference` is a reference to a `sieve.function` or `sieve.Model` that has already been deployed by you or another user. The power of `sieve.reference` is that it allows you to use a `sieve.function` or `sieve.Model` that has already been deployed without having to re-deploy it. For example, you might choose to use a "video splitter" utility already deployed at `sieve-developer/video-splitter`.

### Video Lipsyncing Example

The example below shows how to use `sieve.reference` in a video lipsyncing workflow.

```python
import sieve
from wav2lip import Wav2Lip

# Wav2Lip takes in a video, audio, and a a set of faces that are tracked over time.
@sieve.workflow(name="video_lipsyncing")
def wav2lip(video: sieve.Video, audio: sieve.Audio):
    images = sieve.reference("sieve-developer/video-splitter")(video)
    faces = sieve.reference("sieve-developer/mediapipe-face-detector")(images)
    tracked_faces = sieve.reference("sieve-developer/sort")(faces)
    return Wav2Lip()(video, audio, tracked_faces)
```

## Arguments

- `name` Name of the reference.
- `id` ID of the reference.

### name
```python
def name(self) -> str
```

Name of the reference.

### id
```python
def id(self) -> str
