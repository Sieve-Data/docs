</Info>

## Install the client package
You can find your API key on the "Settings" page of the dashboard.
```bash
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-client-package/sievedata-0.0.1.3-py3-none-any.whl
export SIEVE_API_URL=https://v1-api.sievedata.com
export SIEVE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

## Create your first project
The project below is based on models that Sieve has deployed already. These are open models that you may modify yourself and are available [here](http://github.com/sieve-community). Sieve is the best way to deploy them on video and make structured queries.
<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from sieve.api.client import SieveClient, SieveProject
from sieve.types.api import *
cli = SieveClient()

proj = SieveProject(
    name="test_project",
    fps=5,
    store_data=True,
    workflow=SieveWorkflow([
        SieveLayer(
            iteration_type=SieveLayerIterationType.video,
            models=[
                SieveModel(
                    name="developer-sievedata-com/face-detector",
                ),
                SieveModel(
                    name="developer-sievedata-com/scene-detector"
                ),
            ]
        ),
        SieveLayer(
            iteration_type=SieveLayerIterationType.objects,
            models=[
                SieveModel(
                    name="developer-sievedata-com/celebrity-predictor",
                )
            ]
        )
    ])
)
proj.create()
```
```bash Bash
: '
# Sample workflow for object detection
fps: 5
store_data: true
layers:
- iteration: "video"
  models:
  - model_name: developer-sievedata-com/face-detector
  - model_name: developer-sievedata-com/scene-detector
- iteration: "objects"
  models:
  - model_name: developer-sievedata-com/celebrity-predictor
'
sieve projects object_detection create -wf workflow.yaml
```
</CodeGroup>

## Push your first video
```bash
sieve projects object_detection push --source-url https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-test-videos-central/01-lebron-dwade.mp4 --source-name test_video
```

## View results and make queries
Visit the [dashboard](https://sievedata.com/app) to view your results, make queries, and more!

<CodeGroup>
```bash Get all faces
{
  "class": "face"
}
````
```bash Get Lebron James
{
  "celebrity": "Lebron_James_[m.01jz6d]"
}
````

You can explore the structure generated by Sieve by pulling down the entire JSON for a given source. You can find all the supported celebrities [here](https://github.com/Giphy/celeb-detection-oss/blob/master/examples/resources/face_recognition/labels.csv).
