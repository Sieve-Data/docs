## What is Sieve?

Sieve is a platform built to power the video products of the future. The challenges today's developers face creating and understanding video are no longer about training models, but are rather about selecting the right functionality and piecing them together to tackle complex and specific problems. Our platform is the best development experience built around this growing trend.

Some features include:

- Pre-built, production-ready functions you can use with a simple API call.
- Call functions from within functions to construct complex and powerful pipelines.
- Instant no-code interfaces for every function on Sieve, with zero extra configuration
- Reliable, horizontally scaling infrastructure based on traffic
- Powerful primitives for building video-specific applications
