## How it Works

At its core Sieve is a serverless ML runtime that's extremely easy to use. Sieve offers many out-of-the-box templates, models, and functions that make it easy to build and deploy custom workflows. This means that you can not only easily use our out-of-the-box soulutions with a few lines of code, but also easily modify them to suit your own needs.
