Sieve is a platform built to help discover, design, and run AI features at scale. AI development is moving away from being predominantly about training & finetuning, and more towards how people combine models together to make specific use cases work. Our platform is the best development experience built around this growing trend.

Some features include:

- Pre-built, production-ready apps and models you can use in a single click or API call
- Build complex apps that use many models in a few lines of code
- Instant no-code interfaces for every app on Sieve, with zero extra configuration
- Reliable, horizontally scaling infrastructure based on traffic
- Powerful distributed primitives like queues and async jobs to parallelize data processing

## **Getting Started**

Every account comes with $20 of credit to get you started:
- [Sign up](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) and get your [API key](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings)
- Install the Sieve Python client
```bash
pip install sievedata
```
- Login with your API key

If running on a terminal:
```bash
sieve login
```
If terminal interaction isn't possible, set the `SIEVE_API_KEY` as an environment variable:
```bash
export SIEVE_API_KEY=YOUR_SIEVE_API_KEY
```

### **Building a simple AI translation app**

Let's build a simple translation function on Sieve. We'll take in an input file (video or audio) + the target language and return the translated transcript.

<Info>For simplicity, our app will only support English as the source language.</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="To start off, let's make a new directory and file">
    ```bash
    mkdir simple_translation && cd simple_translation
    ```

    And copy the following code into `simple_translation/main.py`:
    ```python
    import sieve

    @sieve.function(name="simple_translation")
    def simple_translation(file: sieve.File, target_language: str = "spa") -> str:
        """
        :param file: File to translate
        :param target_language: Language code to translate to. Defaults to "spa" for Spanish.
        """

        transcribe = sieve.function.get("sieve/speech_transcriber")
        translate = sieve.function.get("sieve/seamless_text2text")

        transcript = transcribe.run(file)
        translated_segments = []
        for segment in transcript:
            translate_job = translate.push(
                segment["text"],
                source_language="eng",
                target_language=target_language
            )
            translated_segments.append(translate_job)

        translated_transcript = ""
        for translated_seg in translated_segments:
            translated_transcript += translated_seg.result()

        return translated_transcript
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Sieve">
    <Warning>Make sure you are in the correct directory! Sieve zips up your current directory to run in the cloud.</Warning>
    ```bash
    sieve deploy
    ```

    Your build should only take a few seconds, after which you'll see a link to your newly deployed function on the Sieve dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a job">
    Navigate to your function on the [Sieve dashboard](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard) and upload a sample file to test out your app.

    You can also call your function via [API call](/reference-v2/api/create-new-job) or the [Python client](/guide/custom-apps/referencing-functions).

    <Info>Make sure to replace `<your-org-name>` with your org name and `<your-api-key>` with your API key.</Info>

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash API
    curl -X POST \
      --url https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push \
      -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "function": "<org-name>/simple_translation"
        "inputs": {
          "file": {"url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/mango-public-models/output1.mp4"},
          "target_language": "spa"
        }
      }'
    ```

    ```python Python Client
    import sieve

    simple_translation = sieve.function.get("<your-org-name>/simple_translation")

    # This will create a Sieve job and run in the cloud!
    output = simple_translation.run(sieve.File(path="./sample.mp4"))
    print(output)
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **What just happened?**

That was easy! We just built a simple AI translation app in a few lines of code. Let's walk through it.

At its core, we used 2 Sieve functions to build this app:
- [sieve/speech_transcriber](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/speech_transcriber): Transcription model, backed by OpenAI's Whisper model.
- [sieve/seamless_text2text](https://sievedata.com/functions/sieve/seamless_text2text): Translation model, developed by Meta.

Sieve makes it easy to use any public Sieve functions in the cloud, synchronously or asynchronously. 
<CodeGroup>
```python Sync Calls
# Running transcription syncronously
transcribe = sieve.function.get("sieve/speech_transcriber")
transcript = transcribe.run(file)
```

```python Async Calls
# Running translation asyncronously
translate = sieve.function.get("sieve/seamless_text2text")
translate_job = translate.push(
    "Hello, how are you?",
    source_language="eng",
    target_language="spa"
)

# translate_job is a Python future, so you can use it in a non-blocking way
print(translate_job) # <Future at 0x7f8e3c3e3e50 state=running>
print(translate_job.result()) # "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
```
</CodeGroup>

We wrote all of our logic for translating a file in a single function and defined a [custom Sieve function](/guide/custom-apps/deploying-functions) with the `@sieve.function` decorator.

Deploying our function with `sieve deploy` lets us run this function via API and lets us visualize our inputs & outputs via the Sieve dashboard!
