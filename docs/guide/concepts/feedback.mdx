title: "Feedback"
---

The vast majority of modern deep learning models utilize some form of "training data" to learn how to make predictions. 
Using [feedback](/reference/api/feedback/intro), you can provide this to our system, and you can specify custom [trainable predictors](/reference/sdk/predictors/trainable) with train functions
that can ingest this feedback and allow you to retrain your model.

With this, you can not only migrate over your initial training set you might have used, but you can also finetune your model by providing feedback to the system on any production data as it 
passes through your system.
