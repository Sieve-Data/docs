Sieve is a new tool that lets you process, understand, and search video without thinking about ML infrastructure and systems, or the software integration into your apps.

## Core Components
1. **Define** - Define your own workflows and models to process video, or use starter workflows that work out of the box.
2. **Process** - Process hours of stored video in minutes. Process video streams in near-realtime.
3. **Integrate** - Integrate into your software apps, dashboards, etc directly via Sieve's API.
    - **Search** - Make structured queries on processed video in MongoDB-like syntax.
    - **Poll** - Poll Sieve's API using a socket-like interface to integrate results for interactive or near-realtime applications.
4. **Feedback** - Improve quality of results over time by providing feedback on results via API.

## Getting started
The great thing about Sieve is that you can get started with it in just a few minutes.
1. Create an account
2. Pick a starter workflow
3. Push a video

...and then make a query to integrate into your app.

## How it Works
Sieve takes a defined workflow and splits processing across many cloud machines.

It then stores the processed information in a no-SQL database in a format that makes it easy to query or poll.

This means you don't need to think about Kubernetes, Docker, or a backend that your app needs to talk to.
