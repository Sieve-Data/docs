In this guide, we'll deploy YOLOv5 to Sieve. By the end, you’ll have:

- deployed a custom model to Sieve
- sent a request to a custom model

Let’s first create a new directory and add a Python file to that directory.

```python
import sieve

@sieve.Model(
    name="yolo-v5",
)
class Yolo:
    def __setup__(self):
        ...

    def __predict__(self, img: sieve.Image) -> list:
        """
        :param img: Image to detect objects in
        :return: List of objects with their bounding boxes, classes, and scores
        """
        ...
```

Let’s now look at the dependencies we need.

**1. Python Packages**:

- **`torch`** and **`torchvision`**: These are essential libraries for PyTorch-based deep learning projects. YOLOv5 is implemented in PyTorch, making these libraries fundamental.
- **`ultralytics`**: The Ultralytics package is a suite of tools designed specifically for YOLOv5, assisting with various tasks like model loading, inference, and more.
- **`opencv-python-headless`**: OpenCV is a comprehensive library for computer vision tasks. The **`headless`** version omits GUI-related dependencies, which aren’t necessary in a server environment.

**2. System Packages**:

- **`libgl1-mesa-glx`** and **`libglib2.0-0`**: These libraries provide graphics and system-level functionalities that are often prerequisites for OpenCV and PyTorch operations.
- **`ffmpeg`**: A solution for handling multimedia data, which can be essential if dealing with video input or other media-related tasks.

To install pip packages and system packages for your model, you can use the `python_packages` and `system_packages` argument respectively. To also enable a T4 GPU for our model, we set the `gpu` argument to `True`. Let’s also fill out the rest of the code.

```python
import sieve

@sieve.Model(
    name="yolo-v5",
    gpu=sieve.gpu.T4(),
    python_packages=[
        "torch==1.8.1",
        "opencv-python-headless",
        "torchvision==0.9.1",
        "ultralytics==8.0.149",
    ],
    system_packages=["libgl1-mesa-glx", "libglib2.0-0", "ffmpeg"],
    python_version="3.8",
    run_commands=[
        "python -c \"import torch; print(torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s'))\""
    ],
)
class Yolo:
    def __setup__(self):
        import torch

        self.yolo_model = torch.hub.load("ultralytics/yolov5", "yolov5s")

    def __predict__(self, img: sieve.Image) -> list:
        """
        :param img: Image to detect objects in
        :return: List of objects with their bounding boxes, classes, and scores
        """
        results = self.yolo_model(img.array)
        outputs = []
        for pred in reversed(results.pred):
            for *box, conf, cls in reversed(pred):
                cls_name = results.names[int(cls)]
                box = [float(i) for i in box]
                score = float(conf)
                if score < 0.7:
                    continue
                outputs.append(
                    {
                        "box": box,
                        "class_name": cls_name,
                        "score": score,
                        "frame_number": None
                        if not hasattr(img, "frame_number")
                        else img.frame_number,
                    }
                )
        return outputs
```

Now deploy this by running the following command

```python
sieve deploy
```

Great! You should now be able to see this model in your dashboard, which comes with a form to try it out as well as an API guide if you want to call it from code.
