## **Introduction**

Let's say you want to transcribe RTMP or HLS livestreams. Let's walk through deploying a custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities for the purposes of transcription & translation.

## **Using the python client**

Ensure that the Sieve python package is installed on your system by executing the following command

```bash
pip show sievedata
```

If installed successfully, you will see an output detailing the package's version, summary, dependencies, etc.

Then make sure to log in with your API key that can be found in the [dashboard settings](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).

```bash
sieve login
```

Clone the Sieve examples repository and navigate into the `audio_transcription` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sieve-community/examples
cd examples/audio_transcription
```

Let's now deploy a custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities by running the following command:

We won't dive too deep into what the code does but at a high level it:
1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. Loads the `sieve/whisperx` model and `sieve/seamless_text2text` model for translation.
3. Takes in audio from `ffmpeg` at a specified chunk size, splits by the last silence in the audio to prevent splitting words.
4. Runs transcription and translation if needed and yields out results with its start and end time.

```bash
sieve deploy live_transcriber.py
```

Congrats, you just deployed a custom function to Sieve! Replicas of the live transcriber automatically scale to zero when there is no traffic, so be sure to check out the [autoscaling](/guide/custom-apps/autoscaling) guide to learn more about how to configure autoscaling for your custom functions if you want to keep them running and ready to process requests. You may otherwise notice a slight delay when you first call the function as the replicas are scaled up.

Let's now use it to transcribe a live audio stream in Python. Make sure to replace **`{your_org}`** with your actual organization name. You can find your organization name in the [dashboard settings](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).


```python
import sieve

url = "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service"
language = "eng" # If this language is different from the stream, translation will happen automatically

live_speech_transcriber = sieve.function.get("{your_org}/live_transcriber")
output = live_speech_transcriber.push(url, target_language=language)

print(f"Started job with id {output.job['id']}")

print("stream ingestor initializing (please set a replica if you'd like for this to be instant)...")
for segment in output.result():
    print(segment)
```

The segment output will print as it's being transcribed. You may also push a job via the REST API [here](/reference-v2/api/push) and later poll for outputs with [this endpoint](/reference-v2/api/jobs/get).

This is an example of a job that will not cancel automatically as it's processing a stream! To cancel the job once you're done, you may use the `cancel` API linked [here](/reference-v2/api/jobs/cancel). You may also cancel the job via the dashboard.
