## **Introduction**

Let's say you want to transcribe RTMP or HLS livestreams. Let's walk through deploying a custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities for the purposes of transcription.

## **Using the python client**

Ensure that the Sieve python package is installed on your system by executing the following command

```bash
pip show sievedata
```

If installed successfully, you will see an output detailing the package's version, summary, dependencies, etc.

Then make sure to log in with your API key that can be found in the [dashboard settings](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).

```bash
sieve login
```

Clone the Sieve examples repository and navigate into the `audio_transcription` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sieve-community/examples
cd examples/audio_transcription
```

Let's now deploy a custom function to Sieve that can ingest a livestream and pass it into other functions using Sieve's function calling capabilities by running the following command:

We won't dive too deep into what the code does but at a high level it:
1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
3. Defines a class `SieveWhisper` that loads the `sieve/whisperx` model and provides methods for transcribing audio and processing the transcription results.
4. Defines a class `LiveSpeechTranscriber` that is decorated with `sieve.Model`. This class sets up the `SieveWhisper` model in its `__setup__` method.
5. The `__predict__` method of `LiveSpeechTranscriber` takes a URL to a live audio stream and a language code. It uses `ffmpeg` to segment the audio stream into chunks and processes each chunk with the `OnlineASRProcessor`.
6. The processed transcription results are then yielded as a list of segments, each with a start time, end time, and text.

```bash
sieve deploy live_transcriber.py
```

Congrats, you just deployed a custom function to Sieve! Replicas of the live transcriber automatically scale to zero when there is no traffic, so be sure to check out the [autoscaling](/guide/custom-apps/autoscaling) guide to learn more about how to configure autoscaling for your custom functions if you want to keep them running and ready to process requests. You may otherwise notice a slight delay when you first call the function as the replicas are scaled up.

Let's now use it to transcribe a live audio stream in Python. Make sure to replace **`{your_org}`** with your actual organization name. You can find your organization name in the [dashboard settings](https://www.sievedata.com/dashboard/settings).


```python
import sieve

url = "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_world_service"
language = "en" # don't pass in a language code to automatically detect the language

live_speech_transcriber = sieve.function.get("{your_org}/live_speech_transcriber")
output = live_speech_transcriber.push(url, language)

print(f"Started job with id {output.job['id']}")

print("stream ingestor initializing (please set a replica if you'd like for this to be instant)...")
for segment in output.result():
    print(segment)
```

The segment output will print as it's being transcribed. You may also push a job via the REST API [here](/reference-v2/api/push).

This is an example of a job that will not cancel automatically as it's processing a stream! To cancel the job once you're done, you may use the `cancel` API linked [here](/reference-v2/api/jobs/cancel). You may also cancel the job via the dashboard.
