## **About webhooks**

As alternative to polling the Sieve API for a job to complete, webhooks allow Sieve to notify your API when results are ready. This eliminates unnecessary requests made by polling, and can get results back faster. In addition, webhooks can be triggered by via the Sieve website, which can enable complex workflows with an accessible interface.

## **Using webhooks via the HTTP API**

The website [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) provides a great way to test webhooks. Copy the unique URL presented to you on the website.

Submit a new job by sending a POST request to the **`/v2/push`** endpoint:

```python
  curl 'https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: <your api key>' \
  --data-raw '{
    "function": "sieve/speech_transcriber",
    "inputs": {
      "file": {
        "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-public-data/assets/dub.m4a"
     },
    "webhook_urls": ["<your webhook url>"]
    }
  }'
```

Once the job completes, you'll receive a notification on [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) with the output of the job.

### **Using webhooks via the Sieve dashboard**

Webhook can also be set on a per-model basis via the dashboard. In other words, every time the model is run the webhook will be triggered, including via. the REST API. Add the webhook on the Settings page once you have an app selected.

Once you submit a run, you should again receive a notification.

<Warning>If a list of webhook is specified via the REST API, this will override any webhooks set on the UI.</Warning>
