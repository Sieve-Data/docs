title: "Typing and Metadata"
---

Sieve allows you to type the inputs and outputs of functions deployed to the platform. Most of the pre-built functions have their input and output types listed on their API Guide page. The types supported out of the box include:

- `str`: a string
- `int`: an integer
- `float`: a floating point number
- `bool`: a boolean
- `dict`: a dictionary
- `list`: a list
- `sieve.Video`: a video file
- `sieve.Image`: an image file
- `sieve.Audio`: an audio file
- `sieve.File`: a generic file object

These types allow Sieve to render forms that can be used to run these functions without code and auto-generate documentation that any other user of the function can see before using it.

```python
import sieve

@sieve.function(
    name="audio_extractor",
		system_packages=["ffmpeg"]
)
class fn(video: sieve.Video) -> sieve.Audio:
	...
```

You can also add an inline comment sphinx format to propagate descriptions for the inputs and outputs to the Sieve dashboard.

```python
import sieve

@sieve.function(
    name="audio_extractor",
		system_packages=["ffmpeg"]
)
class fn(video: sieve.Video) -> sieve.Audio:
	"""
  :param video: a video to extract audio from
  :return: the extracted audio
  """
```

Sieve also lets you add other metadata including a cover image, description, and README which you can do as follows. 

```python
import sieve

metadata = sieve.Metadata(
	description="Convert video to audio",
	code_url="https://github.com/",
	tags=["Audio"],
	readme=open("README.md", "r").read(),
)

@sieve.function(
    name="audio_extractor",
		system_packages=["ffmpeg"],
		metadata=metadata
)
class fn(video: sieve.Video) -> sieve.Audio:
	"""
  :param video: a video to extract audio from
  :return: the extracted audio
  """
```
