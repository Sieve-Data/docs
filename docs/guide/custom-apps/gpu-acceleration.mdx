Sieve letâ€™s you run code on GPUs. To do so, all you need to do is add a `gpu` tag to your function with the GPU you want. Today, Sieve offers a couple machine configurations listed below.

| Name | GPU | Memory (GB) | vCPUs | Tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T4 (default) | T4 | 16 | 4 | `t4` |
| A100-40GB | A100-40GB | 85 | 12 | `a100` |
| A100-20GB | A100-20GB | 42.5 | 6 | `a100-20gb` |
| V100 | V100 | 16 | 4 | `v100` |
| L4 | L4 | 32 | 8 | `l4` |

You can specify one of these in code as follows.

```python
@sieve.function(
	name="gpu_function",
	gpu="t4" # Tag
)
def runs_on_gpu(video: sieve.Video) -> sieve.Video:
	...
```
