## **About webhooks**

As an alternative to polling the Sieve API for a job to complete, webhooks allow Sieve to notify your API when results are ready. This eliminates unnecessary requests made by polling, and can get results back faster. In addition, webhooks can be triggered by the Sieve website, which can enable complex workflows with an accessible interface.

Webhooks in Sieve are sent as POST requests and are sent once regardless of the status of the response. We currently don't provide a signature to verify sender, but it is a feature we are looking into.

## **Event types**

See the [API reference](/reference-v2/api/create-new-job#webhooks) for all event types and response information.

## **Using webhooks via the HTTP API**

The website [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) provides a great way to test webhooks. Copy the unique URL presented to you on the website.

Submit a new job by sending a POST request to the **`/v2/push`** endpoint:

```python
  curl 'https://mango.sievedata.com/v2/push' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: <your api key>' \
  --data-raw '{
    "function": "sieve/speech_transcriber",
    "inputs": {
        "file": {
          "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/sieve-public-data/assets/dub.m4a"
      }
     },
    "webhooks": [{
            "type": "<event type>",
            "url": "<your webhook url>"
        }]
  }'
```

Once the job completes, you'll receive a notification on [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) with the output of the job.

## **Using webhooks via the Python client**

Webhooks can also be set via the Python client with the `webhooks` parameter.

```python
f = sieve.function.get("...")
f.run(
    target_audio,
    webhooks=[
        {
            "type": "<event type>",
            "url": "<your webhook url>"
        }
    ]
)
```

The code will run as usual, with the added benefit of a webhook being triggered once the job is complete.

## **Using webhooks via the Sieve dashboard**

Webhooks can also be set on a per-function basis via the dashboard. In other words, every time the function is run (from the UI, REST API, or Python client), the webhook will be triggered. Add the webhook on the Settings page once you have a function selected.

Once you submit a run, you should again receive a notification.

 <Warning>If a list of webhooks is specified via the REST API or Python client, this will override any webhooks set on the UI.</Warning>
