Sieve automatically scales functions up and down based on the traffic sent to them. We do this by analyzing how long your functions typically take to initialize and run to figure out how many replicas to have up at any given moment.

We also give users a lever to pick the minimum and maximum replicas that a given function may have up at any given moment from the dashboard.
