Sieve automatically scales functions up and down based on traffic sent to them. The autoscaler implementation is based on job queue length, current replica count, and average setup time (which depends on your container size and setup function). To handle bursty workloads better, we also keep replicas up for some time after a job is completed. For more granular control over this autoscaling behavior, feel free to [reach out](https://discord.com/invite/Pnh97rvRtD)!

We also give users a lever to pick the minimum and maximum replicas that a given function may have up at any given moment from the dashboard. This can be accessed via any function version settings.

For use cases where cold starts greatly affect performance, we suggest keeping a few min replicas up. However, your usage does also include idle time (time where your function is not processing any jobs). To track your usage, refer to the [Usage tab](https://sievedata.com/dashboard/usage) in the dashboard.
