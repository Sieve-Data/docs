title: "Additions"
api: "POST https://api.sievedata.com/v1/feedback/add_object"
---

Submit the additions of any objects the system completely missed. Feedback is specified in the `additions` parameter in the same format as the payloads returned by the [/query](/query/metadata) endpoint. The system will automatically add the objects specified and then improve itself automatically based on the feedback.

The additions must specify the `class` of the object to be added along with at least one temporal bounding box position.

### Parameters
