title: "Initialize a New Project"

<RequestSimple method="POST">https://api.sievedata.com/v1/init_project</RequestSimple>

Create a new Sieve project, which is defined by a workflow configuration. A workflow is set of rules that specify the different models and algorithms that run on data submitted to the project. If you're using the public free trial, you'll have a constrained set of preconfigured projects to try out though Sieve does support all sorts of custom use cases given the flexibility of Sieve workflows.

If you're interested in custom projects or models, please reach out [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXC2lotHC_9PTgYyqzJUsPgfeU2W5sii7sEWcQB1kfNGKQxw/viewform).
