## Overview

`sieve.File` is a utility class that helps with handling files that are inputs to a `function`, produced locally in the file system, or downloaded from an external url. The underlying contents in a `sieve.File` are backed by Sieve's file servers and are downloaded lazily, meaning that they will not download the content until requested with the `path` property. This means that a `sieve.File` can be passed around to different functions efficiently without having to deal with network overhead, allowing for more efficnient applications.

```python
class File(sieve.Struct):
```

A type that represents a file.

## Constructor Arguments
- `url` (str): The URL of the file to download.
- `path` (str): The local path to the file.


A `File` can be instantiated in two ways, either by providing a local file path, or an external url.

```python
import sieve

# Instantiate a sieve File with a local file path
local_file = sieve.File(path="path/to/file.txt")

# Instantiate a sieve File with a url
external_file = sieve.File(url="example.com/file.txt")

## Properties
```
### path
```python
@property
def path(self) -> str:
```

The local path to the file. This will download the file if it is not downloaded already, and return the path of the downloaded file.

```python
import sieve

# Instantiate a File with a url
my_file = sieve.File(url="example.com/file.txt")

# Download the file, open it, and read the contents
opened_file = open(my_file.path, "r")
print(opened_file.read())
```
