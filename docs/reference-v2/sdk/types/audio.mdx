```python
class Audio(sieve.File)
```

## Overview

`sieve.Audio` is a utility class that helps with dealing with Audio files. `sieve.Audio` is backed by [sieve.File](/reference-v2/sdk/types/file), so it has the same network overhead benefits. Currently, `sieve.Audio` does not provide any utilities over `sieve.File`, but we are working on adding some useful helper functions. See the [sieve.File](/reference-v2/sdk/types/file) documentation for more info.

## Example

```python
import sieve

from playsound import playsound
 
# initialize audio object with url
audio = sieve.Audio(url="example/sound.mp4")

# downloads and plays audio
playsound(audio.path) 
```
