This endpoint triggers either a function or a model with a given set of inputs. The structure of the inputs should match the inputs types specified in the function or model definition.

## Example
A function that takes in a `sieve.Video` named `video` and a `sieve.Image` named `image` would be triggered with the following request:
```json
{
  "function": "sieve/sample_function",
  "inputs": {
    "video": {
      "url": "{SOME_VIDEO_URL}"
    },
    "image": {
      "url": "{SOME_IMAGE_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

A function that takes in a `string` named `prompt` would be triggered with the following request:
```json
{
  "function": "sieve/some_function",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "some string"
  }
}
```
