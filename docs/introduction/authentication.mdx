## <Heading hidden>Authentication</Heading>

The Sieve API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Sieve dashboard](https://app.sievedata.com/).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

```bash
curl "https://api.sievedata.com/v1/get_projects" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
