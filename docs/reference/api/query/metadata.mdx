<RequestSimple method="POST">https://api.sievedata.com/v1/query</RequestSimple>

Retrieve a set of objects that match a query. Sieve can be queried in way that's similar to MongoDB. Currently, the following [MongoDB operations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/#comparison) are supported on all tags that exist within an object.

### Operations

- [$exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/)
- [$gte](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/gte/)
- [$gt](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/gt/)
- [$lte](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/lte/)
- [$lt](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/lt/)
- [$ne](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/ne/)
- [$in](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/in/)

To see the schema of your project (which will determine how you use the above operations), you can call the [/get_project_info](/projects/info) endpoint. Attributes that change over time are encoded under the `temporal` attribute of an object while static attributes exist on the top-level.

Because return payload can be large, Sieve batches that payload into multiple pages which can be specificied using the `next_start` param. You will get the next start index in `next_start` everytime you make a query which you can include in your next query. If there are no more pages, `next_start` will be -1. The max batch size possible is 7500 objects, and the default batch size is 5000 objects. You also will get `total_samples`, which is the total amount of samples that satisfy your query.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ---- |
| `project_name` | string | The name of the project |
| `next_start` | (optional) int | The amount of objects to skip in query (defaults to 0, used for paging) |
| `YOUR_TAG` | (optional) object or string | One of many tags in your schema. (you can specify as many of these as you want). These can be queried for in mongo format.

**Note**: For projects with a field in the tag schema that contains has a "_type" of "text", you can use the [MongoDB Legacy text query engine](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/text-search-operators/) to search for text information throughout the project. For more information, get started with a text enabled project like E-Sports or Live Social today!
