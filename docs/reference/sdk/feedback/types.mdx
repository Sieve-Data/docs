title: "Feedback Primitives"
---

We've gone over objects and how predictors interface with them. However, we still have not covered
how to use feedback that you have supplied to retrain your model.

We refactor all feedback that you have submitted into the same input/output format as the predict
function. This means that you can use similar code to train your model as you do to predict

We've defined some types below that are used to define input/output for your train function.

<CodeGroup>

```python State 

class State(BaseModel, extra=Extra.allow):
    """
    State is a class that is used to provide the input state of the predictor for a given feedback
    """

```

``` python Sample

class Sample(BaseModel):
    """
    A sample is a single input-output example in a dataset
    """
    input: State
    output: Any

    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = SievePredictor.ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES
    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = SievePredictor.ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES

```

``` python TemporalSample

class TemporalSample(Sample):
    """
    A temporal sample is a sample that has a temporal component, used in TemporalDataset
    """
    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = TemporalPredictor.ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES 
    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = TemporalPredictor.ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES

```

``` python ObjectSample

class ObjectSample(Sample):
    """
    An object sample is a sample that has a single object, used in ObjectDataset
    """
    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = ObjectPredictor.ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES 
    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES: ClassVar[List] = ObjectPredictor.ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES

```
