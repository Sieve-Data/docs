title: "Trainable Predictors"
---

In the event you want to have the ability to train your models, you can inherit a TrainablePredictor, 
which allows support for a user defined "train" method, which takes in a Sieve Dataset that's defined
from user feedback.

<CodeGroup>

```python TrainablePredictor

class TrainablePredictor(SievePredictor):
    """
    A trainable predictor is a predictor that can be trained on a dataset.
    """
    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES = []
    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES = []

    def train(self, dataset: Dataset):
        pass

```

```python TrainableTemporalPredictor

class TrainableTemporalProcessor(TemporalProcessor, TrainableProcessor):
    """
    A trainable temporal processor is a predictor that processes a objects with a temporal component over the last n frames, 
    and can be trained on a dataset
    """
    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES = TemporalProcessor.ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES

    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES = TemporalProcessor.ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES


```

```python TrainableObjectPredictor

class TrainableObjectPredictor(ObjectPredictor, TrainablePredictor):
    """
    A trainable object predictor is a predictor that processes an object, and can be trained on a dataset
    """
    ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES = ObjectPredictor.ALLOWED_INPUT_TYPES

    ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES = ObjectPredictor.ALLOWED_OUTPUT_TYPES
