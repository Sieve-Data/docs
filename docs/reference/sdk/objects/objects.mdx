## Object
In the concepts section, we went over how objects work and the motivation behind them. Below, here are some ways objects are defined in python by Sieve.

<CodeGroup>

```python StaticObject

# from sieve.types import StaticObject

class StaticObject(SieveBaseModel, extra=Extra.allow):
    """
    A static object contains all static information about an object that does not change over time.
    This includes, at minimum, the object's class and its attributes.

    In the event you only wanted to retrieve or store static variables, this is a low overhead way to do so.
    """

    fields: ClassVar[Dict[str, type]] = {
        OBJECT_ID: str,
        CLASS: str,
        START_FRAME: int,
        END_FRAME: int,
        SKIP_FRAMES: int
    }

    defaults: ClassVar[Dict[str, Field]] = {
        OBJECT_ID: None,
        SKIP_FRAMES: 1
    }
```

```python Object

# from sieve.types import Object

class Object(StaticObject, extra=Extra.allow):
    """
    An object contains all information about an object that is tracked over time.
    This includes, at minimum, the object's bounding box and its velocity.
    It also contains all static information about the object, such as its class and object id.

    This is a direct implementation of the object definition on the concepts page.
    """

    fields : ClassVar[Dict[str, type]] = {
        TEMPORAL: List[Temporal]
    }

    defaults: ClassVar[Dict[str, Field]] = {
        TEMPORAL: []
    }

    def get_temporal(self, frame_number: int = None) -> Temporal: 
        """
        Get the temporal object at a specific frame number
        """
    
    def get_static_attribute(self, key: str):
        """
        Get the static attribute of the object
        """

    def get_temporal_attribute(self, key: str, frame_number: int):
        """
        Get the temporal attribute of the object at a specific frame number
        """

    def set_temporal(self, temporal: Temporal, interpolate: bool = False):
        """
        Set the temporal object at a specific frame number
        
        If interpolate is True, then the object's BoundingBox will be interpolated between the previous and next frame
        """
    
    def append_temporal(self, temporal: Temporal):
        """
        Append a newly detected temporal object to the end of the object's temporal list
        """

    def slice(self, start_frame: int = None, end_frame: int = None, frame_number: int = None):
        """
        Slice the temporal object to only include the frames between start_frame and end_frame, return an ObjectSlice
        """
```

```python ObjectSlice

# from sieve.types import ObjectSlice

class ObjectSlice(Object, extra = Extra.allow):
    """
    This is an object that contains the static info of an object and
    a subsection, or "slice" of its temporal info.
    """

    fields: ClassVar[Dict[str, type]] = {
        SLICE_END_FRAME: int,
        SLICE_START_FRAME: int,
    }

```

```python SingleObject

# from sieve.types import SingleObject
class SingleObject(ObjectSlice, extra = Extra.allow):
    """
    This is an object that only contains a single temporal instance.

    Use this when you want to get the static information of an object,
    along with the temporal information at a specific frame.
    """

    fields: ClassVar[Dict[str, type]] = {
        FRAME_NUMBER: int
    }

```

## Temporal

Temporal is a class that contains all the information about an object at a specific frame, including its bounding box, frame_number, and velocity.
This is a way for us to gather all temporal attributes of an object at a given moment in time in one place. It essentially functions as an AttrDict
with some extra functionality, a few required fields, and the methods of the SieveBaseModel.

<CodeGroup>

```python Temporal

# from sieve.types import Temporal

class Temporal(SieveBaseModel, extra=Extra.allow):
    """
    A temporal contains all information about an object at a specific frame.
    This includes, at minimum, the object's bounding box and its velocity.
    """

    fields: ClassVar[Dict[str, type]] = {
        BOUNDING_BOX: BoundingBox,
        FRAME_NUMBER: int,
        VELOCITY: Velocity
    }

    defaults: ClassVar[Dict[str, Field]] = {
        VELOCITY: None
    }
